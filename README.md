# FakeNewsDetection

In an age of data and social media, the amount of fake news being propogated is increasing day by day. In this project I have used Passive Aggressive Classifier to classify the given news as either 'FAKE' or 'REAL'. In this I have used TfidfVectorizer to convert the text data into a vector form where each word has it's own weight. The model predicts the label for the new test dataset with 93.05% accuracy.
